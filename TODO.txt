* Split trigger ints for different data streams
* Include TClonesArray of TVector3 for simVertex (Just save z position of simVertex; x = y = 0)
* genJet flavor matching
* pfIsolation for muons and electrons
* save MET as TCMet not TClonesArray (DONE)
* Modify trigger path specification
* ...

* Still need to address triggers, pfIsolation, and genJet flavor
* I added number of in-time PU vertices; I suggest we add a class to store out-of-time PU by BX and the z positions.
 
July 12

* Same as before
* Possibly save trigger objects or do some matching in ntupler
* Include MET corrections.
